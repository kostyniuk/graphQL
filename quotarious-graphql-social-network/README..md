Social network protype.
I used NodeJS, Express, GraphQL and PostgresQL
Hashed passwords generated by bcryptjs
Authentication is realized via jsonwebtoken

Usage:

First of all you need to have a mail:
- Creation of it realized with CreateMail resolver:
  You need to specify your first and last names, email adress and a password
 All the mail data is stored in mail table(password hashed) 

Then, you can create a user in the social network:
- CreateUser resolver: 
  You need to provide willing nickname
  (if someone uses the nickname, you'll see an error
  that this username isn't available),
  email(should be valid and already created) and a password
   All the user data is stored in bloger table(password hashed)
 
Now you can login and create posts. 

To login you need to enter mail and password and  only if they are correct, you
will be logged in as the user, which info you have provided. So, now you
can create posts, like any post and follow other users.

To create post you need to specify body of it.
Only authentificated users can create posts

Users can update only their posts to do that they ought to be logged in
 
Also, if you wish you can modify your user's info, to do this you
 need to be logged in.
 
To follow other blogers you need to use followUser controller
 and pass id of a user you're willing to follow.
When you follow someone, you can see them in your following section, and
 they will see you in their followedBy section
 
 To like a post, use likePost() and specify post's id
 
 Every post have fields: author(creator's id) and likes(ids of users who liked it)
 
 Of course, you can anytime delete user, mail or post(if you've created it)
